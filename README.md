<h1>Tron Fan Site Project</h1>

Live Site Here: <a href="https://clockwerkz.github.io/tron/">The Grid: A Tron Fan Site</a>

This is my 1-Week Build Challenge entry offered by Faith Wallace. The project goal is to build a simple page
that is dedicated to a movie, book or television series. I've decided to do my page based on the Tron franchise.

<h2>Day 1</h2>
The starting day is basically creating the git repo and building the file structure for the project. The instructions are to create
the file folders, and download bootstrap for use as the framework, and font-awesome for icons. Finally, we are to create our initial
index.html page, and include two or three fonts to use in the page and link them in the index file.<br>
---------<br>
I went ahead and added the file structure and my initial index.html file. The two fonts I decided on using are Montserrat for the Headlines, and Open-Sans for the body text. I might change that, but for now I think I'll go with those. I copied the font-awesome resources into my css folder, and opted to use the bootstrap cdn instead of downloading the code. I also created a style.css and linked it in the index file. On to day 2!

<h2>Day 2</h2>
Today the assignment requirement was to first create a simple section with some sort of selector (the example used an id of "cover", so I went with that). Inside the section are two wrapper divs to frame the section up. The second requirement was to find an image about our subject and use that as the background of the section. Once that was done, we were to select two or three colors and use one of them to create a bottom border for the section. I added a little margin to the bottom of the section temporarily to create some division.<br>
Next, Day 3!

<h2>Day 3</h2>
These are the instructions for Day 3:<br>
Day 3 is about working on the next section after the hero section. We are to find, resize and insert images, and include a live link. <br>
The idea is to take the chosen images and edit them so that they are all the same size. Then, divide 12 by the number of images you have and lay them out based on that number (number of colums). If there are too many images, make another row. <br>
You may add a title for each image. Then, provide a link at the bottom of the section where one may purchase the books, DVDs, etc. <br>
The email provides a couple of examples to look at for reference. <br>
Ok, time to get to work!<br>
Here's a quick sketch of the layout I'm thinking of doing for this section:<br>

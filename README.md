<h1>Star Wars Fan Site Project</h1>

Live Site Here: <a href="https://clockwerkz.github.io/fansite/">Star Wars Fan Site</a>

This is my 1-Week Build Challenge entry offered by Faith Wallace. The project goal is to build a simple page
that is dedicated to a movie, book or television series. I've decided to do my page based on the Star Wars franchise.

<h2>Day 1</h2>
The starting day is basically creating the git repo and building the file structure for the project. The instructions are to create
the file folders, and download bootstrap for use as the framework, and font-awesome for icons. Finally, we are to create our initial
index.html page, and include two or three fonts to use in the page and link them in the index file.<br>
---------<br>
I went ahead and added the file structure and my initial index.html file. The two fonts Idecided on using are Montserrat for the Headlines, and Open-Sans for the body text. I might change that, but for now I think I'll go with those. I copied the font-awesome resources into my css folder, and opted to use the bootstrap cdn instead of downloading the code. I also created a style.css and linked it in the index file. On to day 2!

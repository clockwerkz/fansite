<h1>Tron Fan Site Project</h1>

Live Site Here: <a href="https://clockwerkz.github.io/tron/">The Grid: A Tron Fan Site</a>

This is my 1-Week Build Challenge entry offered by Faith Wallace. The project goal is to build a simple page
that is dedicated to a movie, book or television series. I've decided to do my page based on the TRON franchise.<br>

<h2>Day 1</h2>
The starting day is basically creating the git repo and building the file structure for the project. The instructions are to create
the file folders, and download bootstrap for use as the framework, and font-awesome for icons. Finally, we are to create our initial
index.html page, and include two or three fonts to use in the page and link them in the index file.<br>
---------<br>

<h2>Day 2</h2>
Today the assignment requirement was to first create a simple section with some sort of selector (the example used an id of "cover", so I went with that). Inside the section are two wrapper divs to frame the section up. The second requirement was to find an image about our subject and use that as the background of the section. Once that was done, we were to select two or three colors and use one of them to create a bottom border for the section. I added a little margin to the bottom of the section temporarily to create some division.<br>
Next, Day 3!

<h2>Day 3</h2>
These are the instructions for Day 3:<br>
Day 3 is about working on the next section after the hero section. We are to find, resize and insert images, and include a live link. <br>
The idea is to take the chosen images and edit them so that they are all the same size. Then, divide 12 by the number of images you have and lay them out based on that number (number of colums). If there are too many images, make another row. <br>
You may add a title for each image. Then, provide a link at the bottom of the section where one may purchase the books, DVDs, etc. <br>
The email provides a couple of examples to look at for reference. <br>
Ok, time to get to work!<br>
Here's a quick sketch of the layout I'm thinking of doing for this section:<br>

I just wrapped up Day 3, moving on to Day 4 tomorrow. (09/21/17)

<h2>Day 4</h2>
Instructions for Day 4 are to embed a video about your series into a new section and make it responsive with the bootstrap classes. I've gone ahead and embedded a youtube video I found, and it's responsive. I'm now currently trying to figure a way to center the video; that's proving to be a bit tricky.<br>
So I just figured it out. I tried various suggestions that I found on stack overflow but nothing seemed to work. I noticed, however, when inspecting the page through Google Chrome that for some reason the div holding the iframe was taking up the entire width of the page, and had a huge height. I'm not sure what was causing this; so I took the max-width and max-height I had set for the iframe and applied it to the div. I then just centered with margin: 0 auto.<br>
The next request was to provide a background color, or use an image or pattern. I provided a light toned color for now; I'll come back to this on the weekend and find an image to use.<br>
The last request (optional) is to find a fun quiz based on the series and post a link. I found a "Which TRON character are you most like?" and linked it. <br>
Day 5 is next: Tomorrow will be a jammed packed family day so there's a good chance I will not be able to work on the page, but I will definitely pick it up the following day. (09/22/2017)

<h2>Day 5</h2>
Day 5 is about adding a section with facts about our series. The assignment is to create a list with either facts or memorable quotes from the series. I chose to go with some fun facts.
